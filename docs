# Accessibility Guidelines & WCAG 2.1 AA Compliance

## Overview

This document outlines the accessibility strategy, implementation, and testing results for the Real-Time Account Balance Dashboard. The dashboard is designed to meet **WCAG 2.1 AA** standards for both web and mobile platforms, ensuring an inclusive experience for all users, including those with disabilities.

## Accessibility Principles Applied

- **Perceivable**
  - Sufficient color contrast (minimum 4.5:1 for text, 3:1 for UI components)
  - Text alternatives for all non-text content (icons, images)
  - Responsive layouts for zoom and device orientation
  - Semantic HTML and ARIA roles for screen readers

- **Operable**
  - Full keyboard navigation (tab order, skip links, focus indicators)
  - No keyboard traps; all interactive elements are accessible via keyboard
  - Accessible forms with labels, error messages, and instructions
  - Timeouts and session prompts are announced via ARIA live regions

- **Understandable**
  - Clear, consistent navigation and UI structure
  - User-friendly error messages with ARIA alerts
  - Language set via `<html lang="en">` and localizable strings

- **Robust**
  - Compatible with major screen readers (JAWS, NVDA, VoiceOver, TalkBack)
  - Tested on Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge, and mobile browsers
  - Uses semantic elements and ARIA attributes where necessary

---

## Implementation Details

- **React (Next.js) & React Native**
  - All interactive components use semantic elements (`<button>`, `<nav>`, `<section>`, etc.)
  - ARIA roles and labels are applied to cards, alerts, and navigation
  - Focus management for modals, dialogs, and session timeout prompts
  - Accessible error handling: errors are announced via `aria-live="polite"` or `role="alert"`
  - Color contrast checked using [axe-core](https://github.com/dequelabs/axe-core) and [storybook-addon-a11y](https://storybook.js.org/addons/storybook-addon-a11y)
  - Responsive design verified with device emulation and zoom up to 200%

- **Backend**
  - Error messages are clear and do not expose sensitive information
  - Session timeout prompts are accessible and announced to assistive technologies
